Issues:
I am very new to Bootstrap, so I had to play around for a long time in order to figure out how to make the layout look as good as I could make it. I used a lot of trial and error (not sure if that counts as an "issue", but thought I would include it here anyway).

Resources:
I only used the Bootstrap website to explore the grid settings, text settings, etc.
